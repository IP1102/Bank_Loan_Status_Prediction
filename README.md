# Bank_Loan_Status_Prediction
A simple ML project based on a kaggle dataset.

I found this dataset on kaggle over [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zaurbegiev/my-dataset)

You can write a prediction script and create a dictionary with values as mentioned in the "Data Analysis" section of loan.py. Then load either of the models for prediction. 
Quick Note: Neural Network obtained an accuracy of 77% and is saved as model_nn and Logistic Regression yielded an accuracy of 81% saved as model_lr on 25% of the data set.

Hit me up for more details! 

I've not worked much on this, but if you wish can please make necessary updates as you wish. 
Good luck!
